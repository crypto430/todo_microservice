## TODO Client

We developed the TODO client using [Angular 4](https://github.com/angular/angular).

## Without Docker
### Setup

In order to use the TODO client, you need first to install all its dependencies.

To do so, go into the angular-client directory and then run the following:

`npm install`

This should install all the dependencies.

### Run
To run the application, simply type:

`ng serve`

then navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)
